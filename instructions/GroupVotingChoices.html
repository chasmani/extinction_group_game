      <p>NOTE TO MAX: ONLY SHOWN ON CONDITION WITH GROUP GAME WITH VOTING.</p>
      
      <p>You play this game in a group of 5 players.</p>
        
      <p>Each round, each player votes on whether to play the safe or the risky lottery.</p>

    <p>The result of the vote determines which lottery all of the players play.</p>

    <p>Each player plays the lottery on their own, and if they earn a bonus then that counts towards their own individual bonus.</p>

        <p>
        If <strong>any player</strong> draws the <strong>extinction</strong> outcome from the risky lottery, the <strong>entire team loses the bonus payments</strong> for the whole experiment, and will not be able to earn any bonus.

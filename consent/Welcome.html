      Hello and welcome to our experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure you can work for 10 minutes without any interruption. Please avoid any distractions (e.g., TV, music, smartphones, children, etc).
    </p>
    <p>
      This decision making experiment involves repeatedly deciding between playing a "risky" and a "safe" lottery. Please, read the instructions very carefully and try to do the best you can with the given tasks. Your performance will be monitored to understand whether you are paying attention or not.

      <h2>
      What will you be doing in this experiment?
    </h2>
<p>
      In this experiment, we are interested in how people decide between risky and safe options in a gambling task.
    </p>
    <p>
      This experiment has a number of rounds. In each round, you will need to decide between a risky and a safe lottery. If you choose the risky lottery, you will, on average, get more bonus in this round. However, there is a chance that you go extinct and do not receive any bonus for the experiment at all. You might be playing in a group with other players or alone, depending on your condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      We advise against participation if you have or had problems with gambling (i.e., gambling addiction) at any point in your life.
